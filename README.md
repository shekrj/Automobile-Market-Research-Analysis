# Automobile Market Research Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power Bi)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze car manufacturers based on the features offered in their various models. By identifying models with the most preferred features, the project aims to rank car makers according to consumer feature preferences. This analysis will help stakeholders understand market trends, customer priorities, and which brands are leading in delivering feature-rich vehicles.
This Power BI project was created as part of a guided learning session under faculty mentorship.


## Scope of Work:

This project focuses on analyzing car models and manufacturers based on customer-preferred features. It identifies models with the highest number of desirable features, compares car makers on feature-rich offerings, and highlights top-rated features across all models. The analysis also explores customer satisfaction, fuel efficiency, and segment-wise feature distribution, along with recommendations for adventure driving, child safety, and preferred body types. The goal is to provide actionable insights for both consumers and manufacturers through a feature-centric dashboard.

## Expected Outcome:
An interactive and data-driven dashboard that helps consumers, analysts, and manufacturers make informed decisions about cars based on real-world feature preferences and segment performance.
